## Key Features 
### 1. Profile Customization 
Students can create and personalize their own profiles by adding their information and interests as well as a profile picture! This feature enables users to showcase their personality and connect with others who share similar interests.

### 2. Messaging System

### 3. Study Group
One of the main features of our website is to facilitate the formation of study groups. Students can easily find and connect with peers who are studying similar languages or are at similar parts of their course. Students can also choose to do some outside study materials together which may encourage more students to learn outside just the course content. Once groups are formed, students will then schedule online meetings via third party meeting software and will meet on those platforms. 

### 4. Events 
Our platform hosts an 'Events' section where faculty members or even students can organise and advertise events. Students can browse through a variety of events such as workshops, seminars, guest lectures and social gatherings. This feature allows students to participate in extra-curricular activities that align with their interests and fosters an inclusive environment for students.

### 5. Forum 
The forum section of our website serves a dynamic space for discussions and interactions. Students and alumni can post questions, share insights, and engage in meaningful conversations on a wide range of topics. Whether it's seeking advice, sharing experiences, or celebrating achievements, our forum fosters a supportive community where users can connect with one another beyond academic matters.
